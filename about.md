Hi! I'm Josh, an adult human male living in Washington, DC. While the sun is up, I make pretty/functional radio stuff at NPR headquarters. During the dark hours, I design album art, web experiences & whatever else needs doing at Subterranea. This is my little section of the internet. There are many like it, but this one is mine. He shares case-studies, blog posts about his thoughts on whatever Kanye is up to, or music he's written.

Content of this site is best sung to the tune of your favorite song.
